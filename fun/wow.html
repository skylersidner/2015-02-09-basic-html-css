  <h1>WOW YOU CLICKED A LINK!</h1>
  
  <h3>That's totally awesome</h3>
    
  <p><strong>Congratulations!</strong> This page is absolutely pointless, but I'm glad that someone saw it.  Otherwise, typing all of this would have been a waste of time.  Where else could I ramble endlessly in anticipation that some lucky soul would click a random link and discover this <em>treasure trove</em> of fun and games?  Honestly, it's a real pleasure to know that people care.  I mean it.  Sometimes it gets lonely on da interwebs.  You know what it's like, late at night, when you're browsing and you just sorta get lost and then you find something you think might take you somewhere interesting but then it doesn't and you just kinda space out and sometimes have a waking dream about fuzzy animals and... and... wait, what was I saying?</p>
  
  <p>OH YEAH!  I was really glad you found this page.  Thanks again, I mean it.  BFFs forevs.</p>
